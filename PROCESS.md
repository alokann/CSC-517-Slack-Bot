# Milestone: PROCESS

## Process

Software development is a complex process involving a number of people, therefore to carefully plan and delegate the tasks equally among all the team members we used Kanban board(Github Project) to keep track of the work.

We developed our software in 2 short iterations:

1. Wed Oct 23 -- Fri Nov 1

* At the beginning of Sprint 1, we divided the use cases into stories needed to be done over the duration of these 2 iterations and also assigned story points depending upon the amount of time required to complete that story.

* Once the stories were defined, we created tasks and assigned them equally among all the members.
Tasks Identified:

  * Web crawler
  * Database Interaction
  * Error message builder
  * QueryBuilder Logic
  * Refining interactions with user
  * Refining intent gathering
  * Logic for getting user token
 
 At the initial stage of Sprint 1, Kanban board looked like this:

  * At the beginning of Sprint 2, tasks for Sprint 1 were already completed and others were still in process.
