# GitHubYodaBOT

## Problem Statement

GitHub has provided an amazing interface for developers who want to develop applications targeting GitHub, known as GitHub REST API. For instance, we can build an application with better functionalities and presentation layer on top of the API. To access GitHub API, it provides various endpoints to carry out specific tasks. But for a beginner, the whole process could be quite overwhelming and involves going through the GitHub documentation a number of times before he could successfully develop his application. Imagine the level of convenience and swiftness the developer would experience, if the user could interact with a chat bot to get the customized example based on user inputs instead of spending valuable time searching for the relevant information from the documentation. On accessing the documentation and online resources, user always gets generic examples which he needs to modify as per his requirements. Even on getting the correct required example, user has to spend more time in learning how to use it to achieve his goal. We plan to save developers the hassle of referring the GitHub documentation or other online resources to seek help on accessing endpoints with the help of our GitHubYodaBot. 

 
## Bot Description

We plan to propose a GitHubYodaBot which can solve the problem faced by all the beginners who aim to use GitHub API and need some resources for their development. This chat bot will provide a platform for users to get customized examples which will populate fields in API requests based on user inputs, without going through the trouble of looking back and forth in the GitHub documentation.As this bot facilitates user interaction, it can be considered as a Chat Bot and fits best into the category of Documentation Bot.

The bot will provide curl commands to the user which he can execute on his terminal. The bot will also give an option to execute the command on his behalf. In this way, it not only provides developers a quick way to find the examples but also gives an up-to-date API request example in case GitHub updates the API endpoints. Thus, the bot would save a lot of time of developers to search for the correct content and reduces significant development time. The bot would be embedded on Slack which is used by majority of the developers and will make it easy for them to communicate with the bot. Also, deploying the bot on Slack can help multiple developers use the bot to carry out different functionalities. The bot in this scenario not only helps to get the correct answers for the developers but also allows ease of usage.
