## Problem Statement

GitHub has provided an amazing interface for developers who want to develop applications targeting GitHub, known as GitHub REST API. For instance, we can build an application with better functionalities and presentation layer on top of the API. To access GitHub API, it provides various endpoints to carry out specific tasks. But for a beginner, the whole process could be quite overwhelming and he would have to go through the GitHub documentation a number of times before he could successfully develop his application. Imagine the level of convenience and swiftness the developer would experience, if he gets an example of interacting with the endpoint of interest readily available as a chrome notification instead of spending valuable time searching for the relevant information from the documentation. Thus, we plan to save developers the hassle of referring the GitHub documentation or other online resources to seek help on accessing endpoints with the help of our ExampleBot.
